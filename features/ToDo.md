I have yet to find a budget application that works the way I want it to, so I am going to make one. The goal of this is to be supremely flexible, but I'm definitely going to be focusing on the paycheck-to-paycheck crowd initially with the features.

To-Do List : BudgetBoss
<table>
	<thead>
		<tr>
		  <th>Feature</th>
		  <th>Story</th>
		  <th>Status</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
		  <td>Expense Categories hold Expenses</td>
		  <td>
		    <ul>
		       <li>Given: A user needs an Expense Category to hold Expenses</li>
		       <li>When: A name is provided for the Expense Category</li>
		       <li>Then: The Category is created with the provided name</li>
		  </td>
	 	  <td>Currently Implementing</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		  <td>Income Categories hold Incomes</td>
		  <td>
		    <ul>
		       <li>Given: A user needs an Income Category to hold Income</li>
		       <li>When: A name is provided for the Income Category</li>
		       <li>Then: The Category is created with the provided name</li>
		  </td>
	 	  <td>Currently Implementing</td>
		</tr>
		</tbody>
	<tfoot>
	</tfoot>
</table>
